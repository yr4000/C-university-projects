Hi!
In every file i added the Hw instructions, in case you will want to take a deeper look and uderstand the code.
All the rights for the assignments instructions belongs to Tel-Aviv university, 
I just represent it here for a better understanding of the code.

The best assignment to look upon to understand my programming abilities:
Hw3 - in this assignment we where told to implement some classes. the codes of the list and the list-elements were given.
      I reccomand to look upon the priority-queue. this is a code i wrote from zero.
      
Thank you for your interest!
